            <p>January 2018 - June 2018</p>
            <h3>Computer Works Mananger</h3>
            <p>In my role, I oversaw and enhanched the operations of the Goodwill Computer Works department, located in the heart of South Austin. At the core of our mission was the responsible management of a diverse range of electronics, spanning from cutting-edge gadgets to timeless tech relics. This encompassed the meticulous disassembly of donated computers for environmentally conscious recycling practices and the artful refurbishment of goods to breathe new life into them for resale.
            </p>
            <p>Our team's dedication went beyond the mere management of products and led to a commitment to sustainability, community impact, etc. Through our efforts, we not only kept electronics out of landfills but also provided access to affordable, reliable technology for families in need. It was a gratifying experience, knowing that our work was contributing to a brighter future for both our planet and our local community." </p>
